      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been three years since I started &lt;a href="http://lessvariance.herokuapp.com/"&gt;my first static blog&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href="http://ruhoh.com/"&gt;Ruhoh&lt;/a&gt; blogging platform is very similar to &lt;a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and also using Markdown, I decided to give it a try after getting used to git and the mechanisms of generating posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruhoh comes with the core feature sets I need. Its building blocks are well-abstracted. For further customization, we can always go deeper to the source, i.e., on my machine, the ruby gem is located at &lt;code&gt;usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruhoh-2.1&lt;/code&gt; - symlinked from &lt;code&gt;usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p0/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruhoh-2.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed the simplicity of Ruhoh so far. Jekyll is as good and there&amp;#39;s almost no difference in the number of steps to publish a post. I was just eager to tinker with a different static blog generator. Having said that, I&amp;#39;m delighted to start fresh with a new blog here. I added a few details on how I set up this blog with Ruhoh in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/estimate/estimate.github.io/tree/blog"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
