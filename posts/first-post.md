It has been three years since I started [my first static blog](http://lessvariance.herokuapp.com/). As the [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) blogging platform is very similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and also using Markdown, I decided to give it a try after getting used to git and the mechanisms of generating posts.

Ruhoh comes with the core feature sets I need. Its building blocks are well-abstracted. For further customization, we can always go deeper to the source, i.e., on my machine, the ruby gem is located at `usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruhoh-2.1` - symlinked from `usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p0/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruhoh-2.1`.

I have enjoyed the simplicity of Ruhoh so far. It will allow me to maintain this blog easily and focus on the contents rather than other technicalities. Having said that, I'm delighted to start fresh with a new blog here.
