It has been three years since I started [my first static blog](http://lessvariance.herokuapp.com/). As the [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) blogging platform is very similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and also using Markdown, I decided to give it a try after getting used to git and the mechanisms of generating posts.

Ruhoh comes with the core feature sets I need. Its building blocks are well-abstracted. For further customization, we can always go deeper to the source, i.e., on my machine, the ruby gem is located at `usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruhoh-2.1` - symlinked from `usr/local/Cellar/ruby/1.9.3-p0/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruhoh-2.1`.

I have enjoyed the simplicity of Ruhoh so far. Jekyll is as good and there's almost no difference in the number of steps to publish a post. I was just eager to tinker with a different static blog generator. Having said that, I'm delighted to start fresh with a new blog here. I added a few details on how I set up this blog with Ruhoh in this [README](https://github.com/estimate/estimate.github.io/tree/blog) on Github.
